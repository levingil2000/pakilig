With Ash Wednesday falling yesterday and your fast officially starting today, there’s something beautiful about us entering this season of discipline side-by-side.\n\nI have to admit, though—trying to keep up with my daily 10k runs while fasting is proving to be a much bigger challenge than I anticipated. My legs feel heavy, and my stomach is definitely voicing its protest by the fifth kilometer! It’s a literal 'run' of faith today.\n\nI’ve been thinking about you all morning. I truly hope your first day of adjustment isn't being too unkind to you. Please don't overextend yourself, okay? If you're feeling the fatigue of the first day, just know I’m right there with you, feeling every bit of that hunger and thirst too.\n\nWe’ve got this. One day, one prayer, and one mile at a time.\n\nAlways yours."
