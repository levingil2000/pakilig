With Ash Wednesday falling yesterday and your fast officially starting today, there’s something beautiful about us entering this season of discipline side-by-side.\n\nI have to admit, though—trying to keep up with my daily 10k runs while fasting is proving to be a much bigger challenge than I anticipated. My legs feel heavy, and my stomach is definitely voicing its protest by the fifth kilometer! It’s a literal 'run' of faith today.\n\nI’ve been thinking about you all morning. I truly hope your first day of adjustment isn't being too unkind to you. Please don't overextend yourself, okay? If you're feeling the fatigue of the first day, just know I’m right there with you, feeling every bit of that hunger and thirst too.\n\nWe’ve got this. One day, one prayer, and one mile at a time.\n\nAlways yours."

  "body": "Hi love,\n\nDay 2 palang pero sinusubukan na agad ang willpower ko. Balak ko sana mag-20km kanina, pero hanggang 16km lang talaga ang kinaya. Ramdam ko na yung 'internal protest' ng katawan ko—parang sasabog na yung atay ko sa pagod at gutom, haha! I had to listen to my body and stop, mahirap na.\n\nTo be honest, nahihirapan pa rin talaga akong mag-adjust sa fasting. The hunger is one thing, but the drop in energy while trying to maintain my routine is a different story. I hope ikaw, hindi masyadong nahihirapan dyan. Kumusta ang pakiramdam mo today?\n\nIn between the exhaustion, I actually started something new! I'm diving into a project exploring SEA-PLM (Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics) at a student level. It’s keeping my mind busy and distracted from the cravings, somehow. \n\nKahit pagod at gutom, iniisip ko lang na sabay nating nilalampasan 'to, at sapat na 'yun para pagaanin ang lahat.\n\nMag-iingat ka lagi. Mahal kita."
